# **Car Parts Finder - Version 1**

**Developing a web app that helps car owners find second hand car parts and compare prices from different vendors.**

## Problem:
Searching for car part can be both:
1. Time Consuming: Searching for the needed parts in different places
2. No Straightforward Pricing: The user not only has to search for the availability of the part, but also has to go around and compare different prices

## Solution:
Creating an application for users to search for different parts digitally, and get responses only from registered vendors who have that part available.
